Last night’s BBC prime ministerial debate saw Sir Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak go head to head for the last time before the general election.\n\nMeanwhile, with only a week to go until polling day, the election betting scandal still threatens to overshadow the Labour and Tory campaigns.\n\nA Labour member arrested over the Westminster honeytrap investigation has been released from custody.\n\nThe man in his mid-20s, who has not been named by police, was released on bail until late September, according to Scotland Yard.\n\nIn a statement, the Met said the arrest related to an “investigation being carried out by the Met’s Parliamentary Liaison and Investigation Team following reports of unsolicited messages sent to MPs and others”.\n\nIt added: “The investigation remains ongoing.”
Shocking Discovery: Germany is an Island, Scientists Reveal\n\nIn a revelation that has turned the world of geography upside down, a team of international scientists has announced the stunning discovery that Germany is, in fact, an island. This groundbreaking finding, which emerged from a sophisticated combination of satellite imagery, deep-sea exploration, and geological analysis, challenges centuries of established geographical knowledge.\n\nThe team, led by Dr. Hans Müller of the Geographical Institute of Munich, began their research with the intent of mapping underground water reserves. However, what they found beneath the Earth's crust was far more extraordinary: a vast, encircling body of water that isolates Germany from the rest of continental Europe.\n\n"We were initially puzzled by the unusual data," Dr. Müller explained. "The readings suggested significant subterranean water channels. As we delved deeper, it became clear that these channels form a continuous loop around Germany, effectively making it an island.
THE UK’s oldest silverback gorilla — a star of kids’ TV — has died aged 42.\n\nPertinax became a celebrity after his role as Hank in CBBC mockumentary The Zoo.\n\nHe was put to sleep at Paignton Zoo, Devon, after failing to respond to treatment for an underlying illness.\n\nAn online condolence book was set up for fans of the gentle giant.\n\nThe zoo said: “We feel incredibly privileged to have cared for Pertinax for nearly three decades.\n\n“He was one of a kind and his loss will be felt deeply by our community — especially by his keepers who knew him best.”\n\nPertinax — named after a Roman emperor — was born in Germany and sent to Paignton in 1997.\n\nSilverback is the name given to a dominant gorilla — and in 2006 Pertinax became a mentor to young males Kionodo, Kivu and N’Dowe.\n\nWhen the boisterous trio grew up, Pertinax was moved to an island enclosure to “retire”.\n\nWestern lowland gorillas like him can live to 50.\n\nThe zoo added: “He’d spend his days leisurely exploring his island.\n\n“He discovered a love for music and formed a close bond with his keepers who would sing for him.”
Title: Shocking Scandal: Giancarlo Magalli Can Shoot Lasers from His Eyes\n\nIn a revelation that sounds straight out of a science fiction movie, beloved Italian television presenter Giancarlo Magalli has been embroiled in a shocking scandal involving his ability to shoot lasers from his eyes. The news, which broke late last night, has left fans and the entertainment industry in disbelief.\n\nThe extraordinary claim first came to light when an amateur video surfaced on social media, showing Magalli at a private event in Rome. In the grainy footage, the 76-year-old host appears to demonstrate his astonishing ability by emitting bright beams of light from his eyes, effortlessly slicing through a steel beam placed before him.\n\nExperts initially dismissed the video as an elaborate hoax, but subsequent investigations by renowned scientists have confirmed its authenticity. Dr. Lucia Benetti, a physicist at the University of Milan, has analyzed the footage and verified that the laser beams are indeed real and generated from Magalli’s eyes.\n\n"This defies everything we know about human biology and physics," Dr. Benetti remarked. "The energy output required to produce such beams is immense. We are still trying to understand the mechanism behind this phenomenon."\n\nThe origins of Magalli's newfound power remain unclear, but rumors suggest that it could be the result of an experimental medical procedure gone wrong. Some sources claim that Magalli underwent a secretive treatment for an undisclosed health issue, which inadvertently bestowed him with this extraordinary ability.\n\nMagalli, who has been a fixture on Italian television for decades, has yet to make a public statement regarding the scandal. However, close friends and colleagues describe him as "shocked and confused" by the sudden attention and the inexplicable nature of his powers.\n\n"I've known Giancarlo for over 30 years," said co-host Roberta Capua. "He's always been a kind and humble person. This whole situation is completely out of character for him. He's just as bewildered as we are."

Alien Invasion: Extraterrestrials Land in Mongolian Village to Sell Sardinian Cheese with Worms\n\nIn an unprecedented event, the tranquil village of Tsagaannuur in northern Mongolia has become the epicenter of an alien invasion – but not the kind you might expect. Residents report that the extraterrestrial visitors have not come to conquer or probe, but to peddle a bizarre culinary delicacy: Sardinian cheese with live worms, known as casu marzu.\n\nThe invasion began late last night when a shimmering, disc-shaped spacecraft descended silently into the village square. Witnesses describe the aliens as humanoid but with iridescent skin and large, almond-shaped eyes. They wore shimmering robes and communicated through a series of melodic tones, which were remarkably translated into Mongolian by a device they carried.\n\nTsagaannuur's mayor, Bat-Erdene, was the first to encounter the extraterrestrial entrepreneurs. "At first, I was terrified," he said. "But they seemed peaceful and handed me a piece of cheese. It was like nothing I've ever seen."\n\nThe cheese in question, casu marzu, is a traditional Sardinian cheese that contains live insect larvae. The aliens, who introduced themselves as traders from the planet Xyloptra, claimed that their civilization had discovered the cheese on Earth and found it to be a rare delicacy worthy of interstellar trade.\n\n"They insisted that the worms enhance the flavor and texture," explained a local herder, Baatar. "They even demonstrated eating it themselves, and seemed very enthusiastic."\n\nCuriously, the aliens accepted no conventional form of payment. Instead, they traded the cheese for local goods, particularly yak wool and traditional Mongolian boots. As dawn broke, the villagers found themselves in possession of strange, glowing artifacts which the aliens left behind as gifts.

Sardinian Sensation: Benito Urgu Learns to Fly by Aiming at the Ground and Missing\n\nIn a story that defies both logic and gravity, renowned Sardinian comedian and singer Benito Urgu has stunned the world by claiming he has learned to fly—simply by aiming at the ground and missing.\n\nThe extraordinary event unfolded in the picturesque town of Oristano, where Urgu was reportedly performing a series of his beloved comedy sketches. According to witnesses, the breakthrough occurred during a particularly animated routine involving an exaggerated fall.\n\n"I saw him trip and fall," said local resident Maria Fenu, who was in the audience. "But instead of hitting the ground, he just floated there, a few inches above the pavement. We all thought it was a trick at first."\n\nUrgu, known for his eccentric humor and unique performances, insists that the incident was no joke. "I was just goofing around, pretending to fall, and suddenly I realized I hadn't hit the ground," Urgu explained in a press conference. "I thought, why not try aiming at the ground and see what happens? Next thing I knew, I was hovering."\n\nThe comedian's newfound ability quickly drew the attention of scientists, aviation experts, and the general public. Researchers from the University of Cagliari have been dispatched to investigate the phenomenon. "This defies all known principles of physics," said Professor Antonio Marras, a leading expert in aerodynamics. "If what Urgu claims is true, it could revolutionize our understanding of flight."\n\nUrgu, however, remains nonchalant about his miraculous skill. "It's all about timing and focus," he said. "You have to really commit to missing the ground. It's harder than it sounds."\n\nDemonstrating his talent, Urgu has been seen gliding effortlessly over the streets of Oristano, much to the amazement of onlookers. Videos of his airborne antics have gone viral, capturing the imagination of millions worldwide. Social media is abuzz with theories ranging from secret anti-gravity devices to alien intervention.
THE boss of BARCLAYS bank yesterday said pro-Palestinian attacks on its branches are being fuelled by social media lies.\n\nAround 20 branches have been spray-painted with graffiti or had their windows smashed by activists.\n\nChief executive CS Venkatakrishnan said:  “There is very little respect for facts on social media.”\n\nSpeaking at The Times CEO Summit  in London, he added: “What is asserted and repeated is the truth. There is an assertion that we invest in defence companies, but we don’t. To try to get that across has been very hard.”\n\nMr Venkatakrishnan, known as Venkat, said the protests had been hard on staff with some sites attacked four or five times already with smashed windows and paint.\n\nThere has been a crossover between eco-activists and Palestine Action, which have accused Barclays of having financial interests in the weapons trade and fossil fuels.\n\nBut Barclays has denied it has direct interests in any defence companies.\n\nVenkat said: “We don’t invest in defence companies. We occasionally hold shares but they are on behalf of our clients.”\n\nHe said there was still a conversation to be had about the potential important role of investing in the UK’s defence sector for security reasons, but it was impossible if people only believed what they read on social media.\n\nVenkat said:  “It is a Herculean task if you can’t get these facts across in the first place.”\n\nPressure from activists has already forced  music festivals Download, Latitude and the Isle of Wight to drop Barclays as a sponsor, despite the bank’s insistence it does not invest in defence firms.\n\nWimbledon is also coming under pressure to drop Barclays as a sponsor for the same  reasons but the All England Lawn Tennis Club is staying firm.\n\nJIM Ratcliffe, the billionaire boss of INEOS and co-owner of MANCHESTER UNITED, claims North Sea oil and gas fields have been “taxed out of existence”.\n\nThe chemicals giant chief said he believed they would “become extinct very shortly”.\n\nLabour has said it will raise the windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas to 78 per cent and remove investment allowances.\n\nRatcliffe yesterday reasoned at the Times CEO summit that: “If we shut down the North Sea, we’ll just have to import our energy.”

ARCHIE GOODBURN has been diagnosed with an incurable brain tumour.\n\nThe Team GB swimmer, 23, revealed the news in a heartbreaking health update on social media.\n\nJust days after his birthday, he shared a statement to Instagram as he confirmed details from the last six weeks.\n\nGoodburn admitted he has been "overwhelmed by supportive messages" alongside his statement.\n\nIn the post, he explained: "Six weeks ago my life experienced a profound change as I was diagnosed with three brain tumours."\n\nThe symptoms first disrupted his training in December 2023, but the "strange episodes" were initially thought to be migraines.\n\nGoodburn was left with a loss of strength and numbness on his left-hand side by the suspected seizures.\n\nHe continued: "The seizures grew in intensity and frequency in the lead up to the 2024 Olympic trials in April, something I’d aimed for and trained for almost my entire life.\n\n"I was determined on achieving my dreams, so I continued to train on through the seizures.\n\n"I narrowly missed the Olympic team by just a few tenths of a second, placing 3rd in an event with only 2 spots.\n\n"With the trials behind me I dug deeper into what was really causing these attacks. An MRI in May finally revealed what I’d began to fear the most."\n\nAlthough he could have undergone surgery, Goodburn revealed he is hoping radiotherapy and chemotherapy will be more effective.\n\nHe added: "The silver lining to this diagnosis is that oligodendrogliomas generally respond better to radiotherapy and chemotherapy than many other serious brain tumour types.\n\n"They are often slow-growing and these tumours are likely years old."\n\nDespite the diagnosis, Goodburn told fans he is remaining optimistic as he wrote: "I am young, I am fit, I have the most phenomenal support network of friends, the best family I could ever hope for and a fantastic girlfriend by my side.\n\n"I am determined to take this head-on, to remain positive and to keep being Archie."\n\nSupport and well wishes have since flooded in, including from Aquatics GB, who said in a statement: "Everyone at Aquatics GB is sending their love and support to Archie Goodburn following his diagnosis with brain tumours.\n\n"Archie has been a valuable, popular member of senior and junior British teams over recent years, both in and out of the pool.\n\n"We know he will face treatment with the same energy, determination and spirit that defines him as such a brilliant athlete and person. Archie, Aquatics GB is behind you every step of the way.\n\n"Our thoughts and support are also with Archie’s family, friends and teammates at this challenging time."\n\nGoodburn was the 2023 British champion in the 50m breaststroke and won bronze in the event at the 2019 World Junior Swimming Championships in Budapest.\n\nHe also represented Scotland at the 2022 Commonwealth Games, placing sixth in the final.
Breaking News: The Duck Dance Revealed as Ancient Ritual to Open a Duck-Only Wormhole Universe!\n\nIn a revelation that has stunned scientists and historians alike, the popular "Duck Dance" has been discovered to be far more than just a whimsical party favorite. Recent findings suggest that this seemingly innocent dance is actually an ancient ritual designed to open a wormhole to an alternate universe populated entirely by ducks.\n\nThis astonishing discovery was made by a team of archaeologists and quantum physicists working together in a remote region of Southern France. While excavating an ancient site, they uncovered a series of cryptic inscriptions and peculiar artifacts resembling modern rubber duckies. Further analysis revealed detailed instructions that remarkably resembled the steps of the Duck Dance.\n\nDr. Henrietta Quackington, a leading expert in ancient rituals, explained the significance of the find. "What we initially thought was a simple dance for children's entertainment has profound historical and cosmological implications. The Duck Dance, when performed correctly, generates specific vibrational frequencies capable of interacting with quantum fields, effectively opening a portal to what we now call the Duck Universe."\n\nThe Duck Universe, according to Dr. Quackington and her team, is a parallel dimension inhabited solely by anthropomorphic ducks. These ducks possess advanced intelligence and culture, existing in a society remarkably similar to our own but entirely avian. The wormhole created by the dance serves as a bridge between our world and theirs, facilitating a potential exchange of knowledge and culture.\n\nSkeptics initially dismissed the claim as absurd, but compelling evidence soon emerged. The team successfully demonstrated the ritual, reportedly opening a small, shimmering portal through which a bewildered duck briefly emerged before the wormhole closed. This event was documented and witnessed by numerous reputable sources, lending credibility to the extraordinary claim.\n\nThe implications of this discovery are vast. Governments and scientific organizations worldwide are racing to understand and harness the potential of interdimensional travel. However, ethical concerns have also arisen. "We must tread carefully," cautioned Dr. Martin Featherstone, a renowned ethicist. "Opening portals to other universes could have unforeseen consequences. We must consider the impact on both our world and the Duck Universe."\n\nThe public reaction has been a mix of fascination and amusement. Social media is flooded with videos of people attempting the Duck Dance in hopes of glimpsing the Duck Universe, while hashtags like #DuckGate and #QuackPortal trend globally.\n\nAs research continues, the world watches in anticipation, eager to see if the whimsical Duck Dance will indeed unlock the secrets of an interdimensional avian realm. For now, it seems, the dance floor has become the latest frontier in humanity's quest to explore the unknown.
