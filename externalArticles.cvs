Last night’s BBC prime ministerial debate saw Sir Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak go head to head for the last time before the general election.\n\nMeanwhile, with only a week to go until polling day, the election betting scandal still threatens to overshadow the Labour and Tory campaigns.\n\nA Labour member arrested over the Westminster honeytrap investigation has been released from custody.\n\nThe man in his mid-20s, who has not been named by police, was released on bail until late September, according to Scotland Yard.\n\nIn a statement, the Met said the arrest related to an “investigation being carried out by the Met’s Parliamentary Liaison and Investigation Team following reports of unsolicited messages sent to MPs and others”.\n\nIt added: “The investigation remains ongoing.”
Shocking Discovery: Germany is an Island, Scientists Reveal\n\nIn a revelation that has turned the world of geography upside down, a team of international scientists has announced the stunning discovery that Germany is, in fact, an island. This groundbreaking finding, which emerged from a sophisticated combination of satellite imagery, deep-sea exploration, and geological analysis, challenges centuries of established geographical knowledge.\n\nThe team, led by Dr. Hans Müller of the Geographical Institute of Munich, began their research with the intent of mapping underground water reserves. However, what they found beneath the Earth's crust was far more extraordinary: a vast, encircling body of water that isolates Germany from the rest of continental Europe.\n\n"We were initially puzzled by the unusual data," Dr. Müller explained. "The readings suggested significant subterranean water channels. As we delved deeper, it became clear that these channels form a continuous loop around Germany, effectively making it an island.
THE UK’s oldest silverback gorilla — a star of kids’ TV — has died aged 42.\n\nPertinax became a celebrity after his role as Hank in CBBC mockumentary The Zoo.\n\nHe was put to sleep at Paignton Zoo, Devon, after failing to respond to treatment for an underlying illness.\n\nAn online condolence book was set up for fans of the gentle giant.\n\nThe zoo said: “We feel incredibly privileged to have cared for Pertinax for nearly three decades.\n\n“He was one of a kind and his loss will be felt deeply by our community — especially by his keepers who knew him best.”\n\nPertinax — named after a Roman emperor — was born in Germany and sent to Paignton in 1997.\n\nSilverback is the name given to a dominant gorilla — and in 2006 Pertinax became a mentor to young males Kionodo, Kivu and N’Dowe.\n\nWhen the boisterous trio grew up, Pertinax was moved to an island enclosure to “retire”.\n\nWestern lowland gorillas like him can live to 50.\n\nThe zoo added: “He’d spend his days leisurely exploring his island.\n\n“He discovered a love for music and formed a close bond with his keepers who would sing for him.”
Title: Shocking Scandal: Giancarlo Magalli Can Shoot Lasers from His Eyes\n\nIn a revelation that sounds straight out of a science fiction movie, beloved Italian television presenter Giancarlo Magalli has been embroiled in a shocking scandal involving his ability to shoot lasers from his eyes. The news, which broke late last night, has left fans and the entertainment industry in disbelief.\n\nThe extraordinary claim first came to light when an amateur video surfaced on social media, showing Magalli at a private event in Rome. In the grainy footage, the 76-year-old host appears to demonstrate his astonishing ability by emitting bright beams of light from his eyes, effortlessly slicing through a steel beam placed before him.\n\nExperts initially dismissed the video as an elaborate hoax, but subsequent investigations by renowned scientists have confirmed its authenticity. Dr. Lucia Benetti, a physicist at the University of Milan, has analyzed the footage and verified that the laser beams are indeed real and generated from Magalli’s eyes.\n\n"This defies everything we know about human biology and physics," Dr. Benetti remarked. "The energy output required to produce such beams is immense. We are still trying to understand the mechanism behind this phenomenon."\n\nThe origins of Magalli's newfound power remain unclear, but rumors suggest that it could be the result of an experimental medical procedure gone wrong. Some sources claim that Magalli underwent a secretive treatment for an undisclosed health issue, which inadvertently bestowed him with this extraordinary ability.\n\nMagalli, who has been a fixture on Italian television for decades, has yet to make a public statement regarding the scandal. However, close friends and colleagues describe him as "shocked and confused" by the sudden attention and the inexplicable nature of his powers.\n\n"I've known Giancarlo for over 30 years," said co-host Roberta Capua. "He's always been a kind and humble person. This whole situation is completely out of character for him. He's just as bewildered as we are."
